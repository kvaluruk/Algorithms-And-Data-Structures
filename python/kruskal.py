#kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning tree

"""
  **Brief** :Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest.It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph adding increasing cost arcs at each step. The algorithm is implemented using disjoint-set data structure here.


  **Complexity** :O(ElogE) OR O(ElogV) where E and V are the number of edges and vertices respectively

  **Applications** :Most of the cable network companies use the Disjoint Set Union data structure in Kruskalâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest path to lay cables across a city or group of cities.
